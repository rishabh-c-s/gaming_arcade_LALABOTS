# gaming_arcade_LALABOTS
This is an arcade of video games, where users can play either TicTacToe, Flappy Bird or Catch22. Coded entirely in C++.

The entire gaming platform was written in the Turbo C++ compiler. Thus, to run the code seamlessly, run it in the Turbo C++ compiler. If you want to run it in other compilers such as gcc, then a few header files and the corresponding functions will have to be modified accordingly. These compiler dependent changes are not much.

While running in the Turbo C++ compiler, if a graphics error is displayed while running the program, go to Files -> Change Directory. Here, change the directory from BIN to BGI, and run the program again. It will run now.

The gaming platform boasts of 3 games;
1) Flappy Fish; which is similar to the popular "Flappy Bird" game.
2) Tic Tac Toe; a popular 2 person game, here you play against the computer.
3) Catch 22; an original game, where there is a cop and a thief, and the cop has to catch the thief. You are the cop while the computer is the thief.

ENJOY!
